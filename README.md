# Git Commit Bars

Log your commits into a Horizontal Bar Graph.

## Tech

Just Go.

## Installation

Go to an active git directory.

```
go run main.go
```

With a build procedure...

```
go build main.go
./main
```

You can also filter via author. Any valid substring of the author's name work.

```
go run main.go -u vinayak
```

OR

```
go run main.go --author vinayak
```
